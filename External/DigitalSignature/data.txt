Two things Avila fears more than erratic buses are PowerPoint slides and income tax forms. The pressure to perfect a plenary talk for the thousands attending the 2010 math congress in Hyderabad, India, induced in him a kind of mental paralysis, he said. After giving a lecture at the California Institute of Technology in 2008, he declined an honorarium of more than $2,000 just to avoid the paperwork. “I would get fired pretty fast from most jobs,” he said, adding that he sleeps well past noon and is “not good at managing time.” But in mathematics, Avila has a reputation for diving headfirst into unfa- miliar waters and rapidly solving a raft of ambitious open questions. His col- leagues describe his working style as highly collaborative and freakishly fast and Avila himself as having a clear-minded intuition for simplifying deep complications. “He has high geometric vision,” said Raphael Krikorian, an Armenian- French dynamicist at University of Cergy-Pontoise in France. “He tells you what you should look at, what you should do. Then, of course, you have to work.” Now a globe-trotting dual citizen of Brazil and France, Avila spends half the year in Paris as a research director at CNRS, France’s largest state-run science organization, and the other half in Rio as a fellow at IMPA, Brazil’s national institute for pure and applied mathematics. (The Brazil-France con- nection is no coincidence; in the 1970s and 1980s, top young French mathe- maticians like Étienne Ghys and Yoccoz fulfilled their mandatory military service with a civil-service alternative: conducting research at IMPA.) In balmy Rio during the summer and winter months, Avila mulls over problems while lying in bed or wandering Leblon Beach a block from his apartment. There, he has more time and freedom to think deeply about his work and to let ideas flow freely. “I don’t believe that I can just hit my head on the wall and the solution will appear,” he likes to say. He sometimes invites collaborators to Rio one at a time for what can only be described as an unconventional work experience. “The last time I was in Rio, I specifically got a hotel near the beach so I could work with him,” said Amie Wilkinson, a mathematician at the Uni- versity of Chicago. After searching for Avila on a beach that was “packed shoulder-to-shoulder” with “oversexed cariocas” and returning to her hotel to try to call him, Wilkinson eventually found him “literally standing in the water,” she said. “We met and worked up to our knees in water. It was totally crazy.” “If you work with Artur,” she said, “you have to get into a bathing suit.” Avila was born to parents who could not envision their son growing up to become a pure mathematician—they had never heard of one—and wanted him to aim for a stable career as a bureaucrat. His father’s formal education growing up in the rural Amazon didn’t start until his teenage years, but by the time Artur was born, his father had become an accountant in a government reinsurance enterprise, able to provide a middle-class life- style in Rio for his family and buy math books for his quiet son, who early on was more interested in reading than imitating Pelé’s bicycle kick. When Avila was 6, his mother—who still files his tax returns—enrolled him at Colégio de São Bento, a conservative Catholic school known for its academ- ics and for the gold-plated, 16th-century São Bento Monastery. Two years later his parents separated. As the years passed, Avila increasingly focused on mathematics to the exclusion of almost everything else—he often did poorly in other subjects and was expelled after the eighth grade for refusing to take mandatory religion exams. He said he “left the school completely unprepared for normal social interaction.” Avila got his first taste of the wider mathematics community just before he was expelled in 1992 when Luiz Fabiano Pinheiro, a master teacher at São Bento affectionately known as “Fabiano,” encouraged the 13-year-old prodigy to participate in the junior division of the prestigious Mathematical Olympiad competition. Avila was excited by problems he had never encoun- tered but felt woefully unprepared. “For the first time, I felt I couldn’t do anything,” he said. The next year, after Fabiano helped him transfer to a new school, Avila won top honors at the state level. Two years later, he took gold at the International Mathematical Olympiad in Toronto. “The first time I met Artur, I knew that he would be pre-eminent,” Fabi- ano said in Portuguese as his ex-wife, Eliana Vianna, interpreted. “Artur was the best of all my students ever,” said the retiree who taught for five decades. Through the math competitions, Avila discovered IMPA, where Brazil held its Olympiad award ceremonies each year. There, he met prominent mathematicians like Carlos Gustavo Moreira and Nicolau Corção Saldanha, and while still technically in high school, he began studying graduate-level mathematics. “He has high geometric vision,” said Raphael Krikorian, an Armenian- French dynamicist at University of Cergy-Pontoise in France. “He tells you what you should look at, what you should do.

One reason that many young mathematicians are drawn to dynamical systems, several researchers said, is that the relatively new subject, unlike the ancient field of number theory, doesn’t require a great deal of prior the- oretical knowledge to begin solving problems. And dynamical systems are everywhere in math and nature. Two things Avila fears Two things Avila fears Two things Avila fears Two things Avila fears Two things Avila
